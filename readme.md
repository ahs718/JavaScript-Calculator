# JavaScript Calculator



I decided to make this project in order to further my understanding on how all three elements (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) of a webpage interact with one another and come together.

I decided to make use of the *math.js* library, which allows for evaluation of expressions inside of a string without having to use *eval*. I utilized math.js to do so because using *eval* is considered unsafe code.
